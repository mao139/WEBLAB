  <h3>history</h3>
  <article class="paragraph">
    On February 2, 1876, the National League of Professional Baseball Clubs,
    which comes to be more commonly known as the National League (NL), is formed.
    The American League (AL) was established in 1901 and in 1903, the first World Series was held.

    The first official game of baseball in the United States took place in June 1846
    in Hoboken, New Jersey. In 1869, the Cincinnati Red Stockings became America’s first
    professional baseball club. In 1871, the National Association of Professional Base Ball
    Players was established as the sport’s first “major league.” Five years later, in 1876,
    Chicago businessman William Hulbert formed the National League of Professional Baseball
    Clubs to replace the National Association, which he believed was mismanaged and corrupt.
    The National League had eight original members: the Boston Red Stockings (now the Atlanta Braves),
    Chicago White Stockings (now the Chicago Cubs), Cincinnati Red Stockings, Hartford Dark Blues,
    Louisville Grays, Mutual of New York, Philadelphia Athletics and the St. Louis Brown Stockings.
