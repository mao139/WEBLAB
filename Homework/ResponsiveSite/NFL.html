      <h3>history</h3>
      <article class="paragraph">
        The National Football League (NFL) was founded in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association (APFA)
        with ten teams from four states, all of whom existed in some form as participants of regional leagues in their
        respective territories; it took on its current name in 1922. The NFL was the first professional football league
        to successfully establish a nationwide presence, after several decades of failed attempts. Only two teams currently
         in the NFL, the Decatur Staleys (now the Chicago Bears) and the Chicago Cardinals (now the Arizona Cardinals), are
         founding members.[1] The Green Bay Acme Packers, founded in 1919 (joined the NFL in 1921, now the Green Bay Packers)
         are the oldest NFL franchise within continuous operation in the same location.

         League membership gradually stabilized throughout the 1920s and 1930s as the league adopted progressively more formal organization.
         The first official championship game was held in 1933. The NFL stopped signing black players in 1927 but reintegrated in 1946
         following World War II. Other changes followed after the war; the office of league President evolved into the more powerful Commissioner post,
         mirroring a similar move in Major League Baseball.

          <p>With the Steelers trailing in the last 30 seconds of the game, Pittsburgh quarterback
            Terry Bradshaw threw a pass attempt to John Fuqua. The ball either bounced off the helmet
            of Raiders safety Jack Tatum or off the hands of Fuqua, and, as it fell,
            Steelers fullback Franco Harris scooped it up and ran for a game-winning touchdown.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Eli Manning dropped back and eluded numerous pass rushers –
            one of whom grabbed his jersey –and launched a jump ball downfield that floated
            between the Patriots’ Rodney Harrison and Giants receiver David Tyree, an unheralded
            backup receiver. At the top of his jump, Tyree secured the ball by pinning it against
            his helmet for a 32-yard catch at the New England 24.</p>
