        <p>Arepa is a type of food made of ground maize dough, originating from the northern region of South America in pre-Columbian times,
          and is notable in the cuisines of Colombia and Venezuela.

          It is eaten daily in those countries and can be served with accompaniments such as cheese,
          cuajada (fresh cheese), various meats, chicken, avocado, or diablito (deviled ham spread or tuna, fish).</p>

      <article class="article">

        <p>Combine arepa flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2½ cups warm water.
           Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate dry ingredients, stirring until no dry lumps remain.
           Let rest 5 minutes to hydrate.


           Knead dough a few times in bowl, then divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on work surface into a ball, then gently
           flatten to about ½” thick.

           Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 arepas, cover, and cook until golden brown, 6–8 minutes.
           Uncover, flip, and cook (keep uncovered) until other side is golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Transfer arepas to a wire rack. Repeat
           with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and dough.

          Split arepas and stuff with desired fillings; serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.</p>
